# Splendid
A online version of the game Splendor

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have Node.js installed by running `npm --version`. If you don't have Node installed, you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Next, download this repository to your device and install git if necessary. There's a bunch of ways to use git with GitHub, but I'd recommend GitHub desktop for beginners. 

Once you've completed the above two steps, install the required packages for this project by running `npm install` in the project directory. Now you're ready to start coding!

Before you start playing around with the code, run the development server:

```
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying pages in the `src/pages/` directory. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Next.js

Next.js is built on top of React, the most popular JavaScript framework for the web. If you don't know HTML/CSS/JS, learn the basics at W3Schoools, Code Academy or another free site. If you have the basics of HTML/JS down, check out React and how to structure components and use hooks. We can teach you some of the basics and help you out along the way, but it's up to you to put in the work to get up to speed.

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.
